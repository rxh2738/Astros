        <h3>Launching Process</h3>
        <p>Our rocket scientists build explorer’s spacecrafts by integrating them on top of a rocket, ammunitioned with tons of propellants. Serious power such as this is required because of the pull of Earth’s gravity. The launch process occurs through three different kinds of rocket staging; serial, parallel, and stage-and-a-half. Serial staging is where the different equipment are stacked on top of one another; the foundation breaks off and burns through the next stage, with a third and fourth propelling and successfully delivering the shuttle into space. Parallel staging has multiple boosters strapped-on which fall away as the propellant runs out, the sustainer engine keeps burning to put the shuttle into orbit. Last but not least, stage-and-a-half, which isn’t our most popular staging as there is higher chance of injury due to a sustainer stage acting like a core while a booster stage disintegrates during flight, although this does drop dead weight making the rocket light-weight ensuring smooth sail.</p>

          <h3>Safety Protocols</h3>
        <p>To ensure the security of our space flights our rocket scientists go through a seven step process as a result of a series of steps and experimentation of any equipment, computer, shuttle, and rocket. These steps define a successful solution after the identification of a problem or potential threat. In order of succession; research, design, prototype, test/evaluation, provide feedback, share. During the research process, our team performs constructive criticism through brainstorming potential solutions with the usage of primary resources from peer journals, academic services, and research websites. Next, the design process is where we use the gathered research to create the necessary solutions by choosing the most efficient model. Then, the prototype is tested through manipulation with a series of experiments performed on it. This testing and evaluation phase occurs until the problem is fixed, this evaluation occurs through critiquing/feedback, refining, redesigning and further research. Alas, when the problem is officially taken care of, the specific process is recorded and shared with how it meets criteria and provides a solution.</p>

          <h3>Recovery</h3>
        <p>Our explorers are required to undergo a period of physical therapy with our expert astronauts due to the effects of microgravity on the readjustment of otolith organs. Along with the supervision of physical therapy, we keep an eye on the mental health of our boarders through mandatory mental evaluations. If our standards aren’t met and we think that you are at threat of harmful activities, we highly encourage mental therapy and relaxation. We want to ensure the safety of our explorers before, after, and during the entire expedition.
